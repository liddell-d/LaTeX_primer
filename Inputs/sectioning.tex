\section{Sectioning Commands}

Certain commands support division of content into logical sections. The types of commands that are available depend upon the document class. The following are common sectioning commands.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\textsf{Command}              & \textsf{Description}\\
	\hline\\[-8pt]
	\verb2\chapter{<name>}2       & chapter division.\\
	\verb2\section{<name>}2       & major section.\\
	\verb2\subsection{<name>}2    & secondary section.\\
	\verb2\subsubsection{<name>}2 & minor section.\\
	\verb2\paragraph{<name>}2     & numbered paragraph.\\
	\verb2\subparagraph{<name>}2  & minor numbered paragraph.
\end{tabular}

Other sectioning commands govern things like front matter tables (contents, figures, tables), appendices, bibliographies, and indexes.

All sections receive a header and sequential number by default. The font and leading have defaults. All of these characteristics are configurable.
