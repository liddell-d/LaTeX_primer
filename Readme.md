#### Synopsis

LaTeX Primer. 

Initial version, July 2021.

Updated April 2022 with minor changes.
Updated March 2023 with correction to section 13.

This directory consists of a primer based upon "Guide to LaTeX" by Helmut Kopka and Patrick W. Daly. The .tex files are in a ready-to-run configuration for PdfLaTeX and related rendering engines.

#### File Organization

The primary file is _kopka_daly.tex_. It is fairly well commented, so the purposes of things in it are relatively apparent. As always, details can be found in package documentation on CTAN or in your LaTeX installation. Reading _kopka_daly.pdf_ while looking at the source code is a good way to learn about LaTeX structures.

The Inputs directory contains files that are included in the main file. These files contain the main sections of the document.
